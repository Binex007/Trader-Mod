# Trader-Mod v5.1
Exile Easy Trader Mod System

This trader system is offered free without any guarantee or promise and users should back up their files before proceeding.
It is compiled by [CiC]red_ned of http://cic-gaming.co.uk from different sources including documentation on exilemod and in game from various places.
I have only compiled what i found, attempted to simplify class names and created files for what i couldn't find and is given back to the community as thanks.
If you use then you should consider sharing any further development, bug fixes or expansions (as i have probably missed objects out or spelled things incorrectly).
This file does not include how to install mods or add to loot tables as that is already well documented.


 1.0.0 Update
New Exile trader: Diving 
A3 Headgear is no longer required as it has now been put into the Exile default trader
Apex addons done as separate file and load
CfgTraders also now in separate file

>> added missing 2 Exile items: Exile_Item_Heatpack, Exile_Item_MacasCheese
